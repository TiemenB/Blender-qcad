The addon is made for blender to make it more easy to draw with precision.
First the DXF export and import addons in blender have to be installed(they are shipped with blender)

When you have installed the addon in the sidebar menu (n) you can fined a menu with the possibility to select a file.
This file is going to contain de DXF information.

Now go to edit mode and select a plane, then press DXF export. Go to Qcad and open the file.
Now you can see the plane in qcad. Now you can use qcad to draw.
The best way is to make a new layer first, and draw in the new layer.
When you are ready you can save the file and go back to Blender.
In blender press on the DXF import.
The drawing should appear on the plane that was selected.
You can select the new added drawings and press the to 3Dmesh.
Now the lines become mesh objects, you can use them for boolean operations.
